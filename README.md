# My-second-Excel-project
The data of my second project was gotten from the playground of mavenanalytics, and it was analysed using excel. 
The data involves the sales of a resturant within the first three months of the year 2023 and shows the most and least ordered items from the resturant during the three months.
The data revealed the cuisine that made the most sales for the resturant and the day of the week with the most and least sales.
From the data, i was able to discover the total sales made by the resturant within the three months and the month with the largest sale.
