# My-second-Excel-project
# The data of my second project was gotten from the playground of mavenanalytics, and it was analysed using excel. 
# The data involves the sales of a resturant within the first three months of the year 2023 and shows the most and least ordered items from the resturant during the three months.
# The data revealed the cuisine that made the most sales for the resturant and the day of the week with the most and least sales.
# From the data, i was able to discover the total sales made by the resturant within the three months and the month with the largest sale.

# Steps taken during the analysis;
After checking through the maven analytics playground, I discovered that the sales data of a particular restaurant was collated from the first three months of 2023, so I decided to analyze the data using Microsoft Excel.
After using power query editor to clean up the data, I created pivot tables and charts from the questions given in the data.
I was able to create seven pivot charts from the data which were named; Top five ordered items, Bottom five ordered items, Highest spend orders, Order trend by day of the week, Item order by month, Item order by category, Trend of order item. 
I analyzed the top five ordered items, bottom five ordered items and highest spend orders using bar charts, as they gave really good representations of the data.
I analyzed the order trend by day of the week and trend of order item using a line chart, as they were just two vehicle types.
I analyzed the item order by month and item order by category using a pie chart.
I created the slicers from the pivot charts to report connections between the slicers and the charts.
I then created a dashboard for my analysis by cutting each chart from the excel sheet and pasting on the dashboard and also doing the same with the slicers.
From the power pivot, I was able to calculate the total sales made within the three months.
I also highlighted the most and least ordered items, the most ordered cuisine and the most expensive item sold in the restaurant.
I then gave an insight on my analysis.
